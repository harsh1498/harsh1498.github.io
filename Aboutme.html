<p>I was born in MD and I stayed in America for a couple of months before I was taken to India,
Where I lived for five more years, where I started kindergarden, and where I spent part of my childhood. 
I came to America around 2003 where I started kindergarden again. At the time, we lived with our relatives
but after six months, we found a small apartment and rented it. Both my parents and I were struggling with the move, but in a couple 
of years or so, I was fluently speaking english and my studies were going great, and we were still in that apartment.
I made a couple of friends but not many stuck around. My first real friend was Rodrigo, him and I
both enjoyed soccer and creating things. We would make paper water balloons and airplanes and it would be a blast.
I later joined a reading club and advanced quickly in ESOL studies. For someone who just came from India three years ago, that wasn't half bad.
I made two more friends over the years. Last year in elementary school, and Rodrigo left. I graduated elementary school and moved on to middle school. 	 <button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">&#8659</button></p>
