	<h2><strong>Announcements (September 2nd)</strong></h2>

<p>
  Rather than sending out multiple smaller announcements, we have
  bundled everything into this large announcement.  Please read it
  carefully, as it contains many important pieces of information.
</p>


<HR>
<h2>E-Text Book Codes</h2>
<p>
  The codes for the Python for Everyone e-text that were purchased
  through the UMBC Bookstore are for the version of the book without
  the Interactivities.  This is true for codes purchased alone, or in
  a bundle with the physical book.  The course instructors have been
  provided with the correct codes, and you will be able to "swap" your
  purchased codes for these correct codes.  If you have not yet
  purchased your book from the bookstore, you can go ahead and do so,
  but <b>do not open and redeem the e-text code</b>.
</p>
<p>
  To swap your purchased code for a correct code, you may come to any
  of the instructors' office hours.
  You should bring one of the following things with you:
  <ul>
    <li>The e-text code, unopened</li>
    <li>The e-text code, opened (<u>do not open</u> if you have not already done so)</li>
    <li>Proof of installation of the e-book on your computer</li>
  </ul>
  We will be allowing students to swap out codes until September 30th,
  so if you have not yet un-shrinkwrapped your book and code, you can
  wait until you are sure you want to do so.  If you cannot make any
  of the instructors' office hours,
  please e-mail Dr. Gibson, and you can
  schedule another time to meet.
</p>


<HR>
<h2>Course Website and Blackboard</h2>      
<p>
  This semester, we will primarily be using the course website (located 
  here).  The website will host all of the
  course documents, assignments, labs, exam information, office hours,
  and more.  Blackboard will be used to make e-mail announcements, to
  access your grades, and for a few small other things.

<h2>Discussions (Week of September 5th)</h2>
<p>
  Computer lab practices will <u>not</u> be meeting in-person the week of
  September 5th, due to the Labor Day holiday.  If your instructor is
  Prof. Neary, Dr. Rheingans, or Dr. Wilson, you do <u>not</u> have an in-person
  lab that week.  If your instructor is Dr. Gibson and you meet
  Mon/Wed @ 1 PM, you do <u>not</u> have an in-person lab that week.
</p>
<p>
  If your instructor is Dr. Gibson and you meet Tue/Thur @ 10 AM (Section 13), you do <u>not</u> have an in-person lab that week.  However, your Guided Review Session (GRS) <u>will</u> be meeting, starting the week of September 5th.  If you are in section number:
  <ul style="text-align:left;">
    <li>14 &mdash; you should attend your GRS at 9 AM on Thurday in ENG 231 (with Katie)</li>
    <li>15 &mdash; you should attend your GRS at 9 AM on Tuesday in ENG 231 (with Jacob)</li>
    <li>16 &mdash; you should attend your GRS at 11:30 AM on Thursday in ENG 231 (with Patrick)</li>
    <li>17 &mdash; you should attend your GRS at 11:30 AM on Tuesday in ENG 231 (with Hailee)</li>
    <li>18 &mdash; you should attend your GRS at 1:00 PM on Thursday in ENG 112 (with Chris)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  <b>In-person discussions will <u>all</u> meet starting the week of September 12th.</b>

<h2>HW 0 and Lab 1</h2>
<p>
  Lab 1 will be coming out Friday evening, and will walk you through how
  to access the GL system, how to navigate around the Command Line
  Interface, and how to setup your folders.  You will also create your
  very first (very basic!) Python program, and email your TA with some
  basic details about yourself.
</p>
<p>
  HW 0 will be coming out Monday, and you will not be able to do it
  until you have completed the portion of Lab 1 that walks you through
  accessing the GL systems.  HW 0 is not a "typical" assignment -- you
  will be following explicit instructions (similar to Lab 1), not
  solving problems.  HW 0 is intended to be a document you can refer to
  throughout the semester to help you double-check that you have
  correctly submitted your assignment files.
