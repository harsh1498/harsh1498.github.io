<p>My goal is to get hired as a software engineer at Google by the end of my college career. Why am I so dedicated to 
achive this goal? Imagine telling people your dream, explaining everything you have planned and wished for, and receving compliment you on your ambition 
and good luck on your dream. Yeah that never happened to me. I was always told that it is really hard to achive my dream. Now don't get me wrong, people have wished me good luck... 
as they were rolling their eyes and walking away. I made my mind since 7th grade that I will sit in a chair at Google headquaters. Now that is not my only goal 
as I also want to learn as much as I can about code, to prove to people that one can learn to code without technical skills(coding well is another story). I feel 
that technology is going to advance society in ways unimaginable tommorow, and one can and should contribute today. To spread that message, I have to prove that one 
person can make a signifant contribution. Imagine developing a navigation screen for a new autonomous car that millions will use and see as their car
drives them to work. Now imagine millions of people traveling on a plane and interacting with thier windows that act as 
displays of information like weather, elapsed-time, etc. Now imagine billions of people the world over having access to a cloud computing office which is use to 
create presentations and business plans. What if you created one element, either a button or a navigation bar? What if you wrote that one line of code that told the car to slow down if things appear in front of the car's sensor, or 
if you made that share button that millons used to share presentations of new inovative bussiness ideas? Well I know I can, and I am sure that you can too, that is how I want to make a difference in society.<button onclick="myFunction()" class="dropbtn">&#8659</button></p>

<p>I was born in MD and I stayed in America for a couple of months before I was taken to India,
Where I lived for five more years, where I started kindergarden, and where I spent part of my childhood. 
I came to America around 2003 where I started kindergarden again. At the time, we lived with our relatives
but after six months, we found a small apartment and rented it. Both my parents and I were struggling with the move, but in a couple 
of years or so, I was fluently speaking english and my studies were going great, and we were still in that apartment.
I made a couple of friends but not many stuck around. My first real friend was Rodrigo, him and I
both enjoyed soccer and creating things. We would make paper water balloons and airplanes and it would be a blast.
I later joined a reading club and advanced quickly in ESOL studies. For someone who just came from India three years ago, that wasn't half bad.
I made two more friends over the years. Last year in elementary school, and Rodrigo left. I graduated elementary school and moved on to middle school.
